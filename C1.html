The more I hear a pop song on the radio, the less I feel like buying it.
The more exciting the soundtrack, the better the movie seems.
The louder the music gets, the sooner I feel like leaving.
The less 80s pop music I hear, the better.

BONUS
Double comparatives
These structures are commonly used in double comparatives.
The+more/ less + clause
The more I listen to classical music, the more I appreciate it.

GRAMMAR 
As if, as thought, as, the way, and like
As if and as though often introduce clauses that describe impressions about feelings or behavior after verbs such as act, behave, feel, look, seem, and talk.
Still, I feel as if / as though something is missing.
As and the way introduce clauses that express a comparison.
I'm thinking of joining a volunteer program to help build houses for the needy as / the way a few of my friends have.
In informal English, the word like can be used instead of as if I as though and as/ the way. 
It seems as though the job was made for me!
It seems like the job was made for me!

BONUS
As if, as thought, as, the way, and like
When as introduces a clause expressing a comparison, subject-verb inversion can occur in affirmative sentences.
With do: Marissa has a lot of trouble accepting change, as does Trina.
With auxiliary verbs: Mitt has coped well with changes at work, as have his co-workers.
With modals: Grandma would tell us stories of the old days, as would Grandpa.
With be: Marcel is wary of technology, as is his whole family.
When both clauses have the same subject, as if and as though clauses with adjectives or past participles are frequently shortened by removing the subject and be.
Bill is talking about quitting his job, as though (he were) single and carefree.
Marvin sat motionless in front of his new media center, as if (he were) glued to the chair.
Notice that we use a past form of a verb after as if and as though when these phrases are followed by a hypothetical or unreal situation.
Bill is talking about quitting his job as though he were carefree. (He has responsibilities.) 
Some young people replace their gadgets every year as if they had all the money in the world.

GRAMMAR 
As if, as thought, as, the way, and like
As if and as though often introduce clauses that describe impressions about feelings or behavior after verbs such as act, behave, feel, look, seem, and talk.
Still, I feel as if / as though something is missing.
As and the way introduce clauses that express a comparison.
I'm thinking of joining a volunteer program to help build houses for the needy as / the way a few of my friends have.
In informal English, the word like can be used instead of as if I as though and as/ the way. 
It seems as though the job was made for me!
It seems like the job was made for me!

BONUS
As if, as thought, as, the way, and like
When as introduces a clause expressing a comparison, subject-verb inversion can occur in affirmative sentences.
With do: Marissa has a lot of trouble accepting change, as does Trina.
With auxiliary verbs: Mitt has coped well with changes at work, as have his co-workers.
With modals: Grandma would tell us stories of the old days, as would Grandpa.
With be: Marcel is wary of technology, as is his whole family.
When both clauses have the same subject, as if and as though clauses with adjectives or past participles are frequently shortened by removing the subject and be.
Bill is talking about quitting his job, as though (he were) single and carefree.
