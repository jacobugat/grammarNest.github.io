Non-defining relative clauses as sentence modifiers
Non-defining relative clauses can be used as sentence modifiers and can contain almost any verb. Some of the most common ones are surprise, depress, encourage, suggest (that), contribute to, and result in. Note that the verbs that describe emotion must be followed by an object.
My husband tried to repair a leak with aluminum foil, which has resulted in a ruined silk carpet. 
My teacher praised my English today, which encourages me to study harder.
Peter has been happier since he took up golf, which suggests that hobbies are good for a person both mentally and physically.
I learned how to clean jewelry with toothpaste, which depressed me because it meant I had wasted a fortune on expensive cleaners.
I've started making my own clothes, which has contributed to financial savings and a full closet!
