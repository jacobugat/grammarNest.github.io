Something that bugs me is people who take up two seats on a crowded bus.
The thing (that) I can't stand is co-workers who / that leave their cell phones ringing on their desks.
Some sentences use a relative clause and a noun clause beginning with a question word such as when.
The thing (that) I hate is when kids ride their scooters on the sidewalk.
One thing that bothers me is when my friends don't show up on time for things.

BONUS
Relative clauses and noun clauses
In some relative clauses, the relative pronoun (who, that, or which) can be omitted.
In an object relative clause, a relative pronoun (who, that, or which) is optional. Relative pronouns are only required when they function as the subject of a relative clause.
My friend told our classmates a secret. I had told him that secret.
My friend told our classmates a secret (that) I had told him.
In a subject relative clause, a relative pronoun (who, that, or which) is necessary because it functions as the subject of the relative clause.
I have a roommate. She never cleans the kitchen.
I have a roommate who never cleans the kitchen.
